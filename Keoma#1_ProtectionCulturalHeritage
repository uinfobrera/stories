## Persona
Keoma has to draw up a renovation plan for a bell tower damaged by the earthquake and wants to know what kind of interventions to implement on the wall structure. 

## Scenario  
Keoma has to draw up a renovation plan for a bell tower damaged by the earthquake and wants to know what kind of interventions to implement on the wall structure. He needs to to avoid the alteration of the characteristics of the cell as a component of the production of the bells sound. Keoma therefore needs to know what kind of sound practices are performed in that bell tower. Keoma needs to know if sound practices are currently practiced and how often, and if those sound techniques involve humans and, if so, how many people are generally employed in the performance. Keoma must also understand if there are significant differences between the sound performed manually and the electrified one, in order to develop indications related to the impact on the soundscape in both cases. Keoma also needs to know if there are documents that proof to the diffusion of this sound in surrounding space back in time, in order to document any prescriptions that he will elaborate on a historical basis.
